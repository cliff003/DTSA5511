### README for Chatbot Arena Model Comparison Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop and evaluate a machine learning model capable of predicting user preferences between chatbot responses. The model leverages Microsoft’s DeBERTa-v3 architecture to classify responses as preferred by users, using data from the LMSYS Chatbot Arena competition. The project includes a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training and evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Project Structure
1. **Objective**
   - To predict user preferences between chatbot responses and classify them into three categories: `winner_model_a`, `winner_model_b`, and `winner_tie`.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizations and statistical analyses to understand data distribution and patterns.
   - Includes heatmaps and bar charts to compare model performances.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**
   - Utilizes Microsoft’s DeBERTa-v3 model (`microsoft/deberta-v3-xsmall`).
   - Implements a 5-fold cross-validation strategy.
   - Uses Cross-Entropy Loss for training and log loss for validation performance evaluation.

4. **Future Improvements**
   - Suggestions for hyperparameter tuning, regularization techniques, data augmentation, model ensembling, exploring advanced architectures, and extended training.

5. **Ongoing Kaggle Competition**
   - This project is part of an ongoing Kaggle competition, and a submission score on Kaggle is not yet available.
